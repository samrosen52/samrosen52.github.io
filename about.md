Sam Rosenberg is a data scientist, epidemiologist, and urban planner. Currently, he serves as a Senior Data Analyst at Boston University, where his work focuses on intellectual and developmental disabilities using large-scale electronic health records and Medicaid claims data. He previously held research positions at Boston University School of Public Health, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and Yale University.

Born and raised in New England, Sam comes from a family of small business owners. Sam spent his early years building furniture, playing with CNC routers, and sketching utopian cities for fun. His path to public health began at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where a serendipitous encounter with an elderly couple led him to discover the work of Sandro Galea—an introduction that would shape the next decade of his life. Years later, he would go on to work directly for Galea himself, designing global surveys and modeling how structural racism, urban design, and economic policies shape health around the world.

Sam holds a Master of City Planning and a Master of Public Health. His work weaves together systems science, urban health, and data visualization to explore how environments—physical, social, and economic—shape mental health and chronic disease. His projects have spanned over 70 cities across 10 countries, incorporating everything from agent-based models to street design to brain scans of people looking at pictures of food. He has consulted for organizations such as the World Health Organization and Bloomberg Philanthropies, advising on city health indicators, policy evaluations, and tools for measuring health equity.

For Sam, the answer lies in data, policy, and the built environment.

His research has been presented at national and international conferences, and published in outlets spanning epidemiology, urban health, and data science.

He is currently applying to doctoral programs in systems science, data science, and social epidemiology with the goal of building tools and theories that help cities flourish—and help people live longer, healthier, more meaningful lives within them.

Sam lives in Boston, Massachusetts with his partner Pat and their corgi Miso. Sam can often be found in the early hours coding in R, writing his science-fiction series, or going on a run with too many tabs open in his brain.
